 # Vision-Language Model: PaliGemma

Welcome to the **Vision-Language Model** repository! ðŸŒŸ

## Overview

PaliGemma is a lightweight open vision-language model (VLM) inspired by PaLI-3. It combines the SigLIP visual encoder and the Gemma language model, allowing it to process both textual and image inputs. Here are some key features:

- **Multimodal Comprehension**: PaliGemma simultaneously understands both images and text.
- **Versatile Base Model**: You can fine-tune PaliGemma on a wide range of vision-language tasks.
- **Off-the-Shelf Exploration**: It comes with a checkpoint fine-tuned on a mixture of tasks for immediate research use.

## Contents

- `google-PaliGemma-Model.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with code for using and fine-tuning PaliGemma.
- (will be adding more files!)

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open `google-PaliGemma-Model.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or any compatible environment.
3. Explore the notebook to learn how to work with PaliGemma for tasks like image captioning, visual question answering, and more.

Happy exploring! ðŸš€
